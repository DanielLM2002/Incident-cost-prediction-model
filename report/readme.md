# ANALYSIS REPORT
The analysis report is a markdown file that contains the results of the project.
The linear regresion even tho is a vary basic verion of learning tecnologies like neural networks, it helps us understand the basic concepts of the machine learning.

The model is a linear regression model that is used to predict the cost of a certain amount of damaged equipment based on an output data given to it. 
The data for this project was generated by numpy and pandas.
Pandas was used to create the dataframe that contains the data and numpy to reshape the data and to make it more readable.

In the notebook you would be able to see the dataframe and the linear regression model.

In my case when the model mas executed i got the following plot results of data generated.
